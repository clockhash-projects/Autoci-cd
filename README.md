<h1><b>Introduction</h1></b>
<br>
Auto Ci-cd generator is a Python-based application that utilizes the OpenAI feature to generate the Docker file, basic deployment, and service manifest file for Kubernetes. Additionally, it generates a pipeline file depending on the provider in which the user provides. This application helps beginner users to deploy applications in Kubernetes and set up pipelines without requiring much expertise.
<br>


<h1><b>Requirements</h1></b>
1.An openapi token has to be generated for using auto-cicd. The steps for activating an openai token is in the link below
<br>
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
<br>
2.User need to clone the application directory to the machine to detect the codebase of the application.
<br>
3. User needs to generate the token for repository access for github/gitlab and also mention this token in the script.
<h2><b2>Architecture of the Application</h2></b2>
The Auto Ci-cd generator consists of a YAML file for user input. In this file, the user inputs the details of their image registry and their password. An example format of how the file looks like:
<br>
<br>

#Clockhash.yml
<br>
<br>
`codebase: <detects-automatically>`
<br>
`registry: <registry_url>`
<br>
   `  password: <your_password>`
  <br>
   `  username: <your_username>`
  <br>
`repo: gitlab`
<br>


The codebase is automatically generated by the application with the built-in code detector function. The kubeconfig file is checked under the location of users home directory and reads the file from there.
<br>


<h3><b3>How to Install and Use the Application</h3></b3>
To install and use the Auto Ci-cd generator, follow these steps:
<br></br>


<b4>Step 1</b4>: Clone the repository using the command:
`git clone https://github.com/Auto-ci-cd/ci-cd-generator.git`

<b5>Step 2</b5>: Use the command below:

`echo 'python3  <location_of_autocicd.py> "$@"' | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/autocicd >/dev/null && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/autocicd`
<br></br>
This command exports the autocicd file. Replace the `<location_of_autocicd.py>` file with the cloned file location.

<b7> Step 3 </b7>: Export the openai key

Use the export command in linux like `export=<openai_key>` and use `set=<openai_key>` in windows.
<br></br>
<b6>Step 4</b6>: Run the command:

`autocicd --code <your-code-location>`
This command generates the necessary deployment manifest files, Docker file, and pipeline file required for deployment.

<br>
Auto Ci-cd generator is a Python application designed to simplify the process of setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for applications. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI, a powerful language model, to automate the generation of essential files needed for deploying applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
When using Auto Ci-cd generator, the user provides some initial information, such as the type of deployment (e.g., a web application or a microservice) and the preferred cloud provider (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). Based on this input, the application generates the following files:
<br>
<br>

Dockerfile: This file contains instructions to build a Docker image for the application. It specifies the base image, dependencies, environment variables, and other necessary configurations.
<br>
<br>
Deployment Manifest: This file is used in Kubernetes to describe how to deploy the application. It includes information about the desired state of the application, such as the number of replicas, network configurations, and resource requirements.
<br>
<br>
Service Manifest: In Kubernetes, a service provides network access to deployed applications. The service manifest file generated by Auto Ci-cd defines the service endpoints, load balancing settings, and other networking details.
<br>
<br>
Pipeline File: Depending on the chosen provider (e.g., GitHub or GitLab), the application generates a pipeline file. This file contains instructions for the CI/CD pipeline, such as building the Docker image, pushing it to a container registry, deploying to Kubernetes, and running tests.
<br>
<br>
The primary goal of Auto Ci-cd generator is to simplify the deployment process, especially for beginners who may not have extensive knowledge or experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. By automating the generation of these essential files, the application reduces the manual effort and expertise required to set up a CI/CD workflow for deploying applications in Kubernetes.

<h1><b>Conclusion</h1></b>
<br>
The Auto Ci-cd generator is an application that simplifies the process of deploying applications in Kubernetes and setting up pipelines. With just a few inputs, users can generate the necessary files required for deployment. Follow the installation steps to start using the Auto Ci-cd generator today!
